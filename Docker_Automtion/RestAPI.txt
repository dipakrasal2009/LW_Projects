5 methods of rest API

1 GET  :  get method is use to get the input or records from the server

2 POST : post method is use to send the data and create the new record to the server

3 PUT  : when we want to update an existing record then the put method is used

4 PATCH : like the put method. patch is also use to send the data to update the existig record 
		but the important diffrence of PUT and PATCH is PATCH only applies the partial modification
